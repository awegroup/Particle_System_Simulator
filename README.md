![nicegif](images/SchmancyGauss.gif)
This repository features a set of tools for analysing the deformation of membranes using a particle system model.  

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/markk116/LightSailSim.git
cd LightSailSim
pip install -e .
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd LightSailSim
```

To verify everything works you can run
```bash
python Simulations\Gao_et_al.py
```
from the root directory. 

## Usage 
### Running simulations
Navigate to the Simulations directory and run the desired script:
```bash
cd Simulations
python Simple_config_round.py
```


## Acknowledgement
